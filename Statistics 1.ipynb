    "Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field; research in statistics finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields and research questions in the various scientific fields motivate the development of new statistical methods and theory. In developing methods and studying the theory that underlies the methods statisticians draw on a variety of mathematical and computational tools."

    "1. `Mean`: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in the set and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is a good measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed or when there are no extreme outliers. \n",

    "2. `Median`: The median is the middle value of a set of numbers. It is the value that separates the upper and lower halves of a dataset.

    "3. `Mode`: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. It is useful when the data is not continuous and when there is a clear peak or cluster in the distribution.

    "\n",
    "5. `Variance`: The variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. A high variance indicates that the data is spread out, while a low variance indicates that the data is tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Standard Deviation`: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It gives an indication of how much the data deviates from the mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out, while a low standard deviation indicates that the data is tightly clustered around the mean."
